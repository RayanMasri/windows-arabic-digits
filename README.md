This has been accomplished by modifiying this [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard) library so that when typing english digits, they are remapped to arabic digits.
But since ctypes does not support arabic digits, an alternative was used where the digits were copied from a dictionary to the clipboard and pasted, but since this removes your previous clipboard I used a timer from threading which waits a few seconds after you type an arabic digit and recopies your original clipboard, although typing another arabic digit resets this timer
